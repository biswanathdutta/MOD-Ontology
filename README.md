# What "MOD" refers to? 
Metadata for Ontology Description and publication 

# Objective 
The aim of this project is to develop a metadata vocabulary for describing and publishing the ontologies or the vocabularies (e.g., thesaurus, taxonomy) having the ontology like structure. 
This project may be considered in some extent as a follow-up to the [OVM2 Ontology]( http://omv2.sourceforge.net) project. 

# Availability 
The MOD vocabulary is available in two ways: 

(i) as a vocabulary specification document. The users can go through the speification page and pickup the required element(s) to describe their ontologies/ vocabularies. The vocabulary specification page can be accessed from https://www.isibang.ac.in/ns/mod/1.2/index.html 

(ii) as a owl file. The MOD owl file (as available in GitHub) can be downloaded and can be directly used to create KB consisting of metadata records of ontologies/vocabularies. The produced KB can be made available as a semantic LOD on the Web. 

# Historical background  

A MOD Ontology 1.0 was first published by @biswanathdutta in September 2015: 
http://dcpapers.dublincore.org/pubs/article/view/3758

This project is related to the work done by @jonquet and @antooland on a new ontology metadata model implemented within AgroPortal (https://github.com/agroportal): https://github.com/agroportal/documentation/tree/master/metadata

MOD was discussed within the [RDA](http://rd-alliance.org)'s [Vocabulary Services Interest Group](http://rd-alliance.org/groups/vocabulary-services-interest-group.html) at the 11th RDA Plenary in Berlin, March 2018. The presentation containing it, delivered by Barbara Magagna is online at <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BYJyZyilVaAgc3w61jlxH5DewmdyA5hp/view>.
